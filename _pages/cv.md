RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 

Cyber Physical Systems Group, USC	Sep. 2022 – Present
Undergraduate Research Assistant, Professor Paul Bogdan
•	Predicting and mitigating seizures by designing and controlling fractional-order networks.
•	Performing signal processing on discrete-time linear fractional-order dynamical systems using fractional differential equations.

Viterbi Information Sciences Institute, USC	Jun. – Aug. 2022
Research Intern, Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Lab (VIMAL)
•	Programmed Arduino Mega 2560 to function as a transmitter of commands to an autonomous system.
•	Used computer vision and machine learning to passively track a mannequin head in 3D in real-time.
•	Compared the computer vision measurement against the true motion as a proof of concept.

Aerodynamics Design and Research Lab (ADRL), USC	   Jan. - May 2022
Lab Assistant, Professor Alejandra Uranga
•	Designed a third-order Chebyshev low-pass filter 
•	Aimed to test the filter inside a Dryden wind tunnel to remove the turbulence caused by the drag force on an aircraft’s wing.
