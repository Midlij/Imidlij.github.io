I am an undergraduate student at USC advised by [Prof. Paul Bogdan](https://cps.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be working with Dr. Bogdan at the [Cyber Physical Systems Group](https://cps.usc.edu/resAreas.html).

My research interests lie in the fields of control systems and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in designing and controlling autonomous systems to improve decision-making under uncertainty. 

Please refer to my [CV](https://github.com/Midlij/Imidlij.github.io/blob/d8497bbc3c700b01d58766b71f8cc876877b74b5/files/KM_CV.pdf) for more details about my education and research experience.

I am currently working on designing a fixed-wing drone to land autonomously after completing its assigned flight path. I will be using a laser altimeter to measure the altitude from the ground, and based on this information, provide predictions for the safest landing. Previously, I managed to deploy the drone and assign a flight path to it. I continue to work on the design in my free time.
