I am an undergraduate student at USC advised by Prof. Paul Bogdan. I am fortunate to be working with Dr. Bogdan in the Cyber Physical Systems Group.

My research interests lie in the fields of control systems and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in designing and controlling autonomous systems to improve decision-making under uncertainty. 

Please refer to my([CV](https://github.com/Midlij/Imidlij.github.io/blob/d8497bbc3c700b01d58766b71f8cc876877b74b5/files/KM_CV.pdf)) for more details about my education and research experiences.
