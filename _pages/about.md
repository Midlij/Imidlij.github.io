I am an undergraduate student at USC advised by [Prof. Paul Bogdan](https://cps.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be working with Dr. Bogdan at the [Cyber Physical Systems Group](https://cps.usc.edu/resAreas.html).

My research interests lie in the fields of control systems and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in designing and controlling autonomous systems to improve decision-making under uncertainty. 

Please refer to my [CV](https://github.com/Midlij/Imidlij.github.io/blob/d8497bbc3c700b01d58766b71f8cc876877b74b5/files/KM_CV.pdf) for more details about my education and research experience.
