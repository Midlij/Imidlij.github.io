I am an undergraduate student at USC advised by Prof. Paul Bogdan. I am fortunate to be working with Dr. Bogdan in the Cyber Physical Systems Group.

My research interests lie in the fields of control systems and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in designing and controlling autonomous systems to improve decision-making under uncertainty. 

ðŸ¤– Please refer to my CV for more details about my education and research experiences.
